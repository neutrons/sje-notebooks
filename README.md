# Notebook examples for SNS jupyter environment

These examples will be copied to user's ~/notebooks directory
when he/she log into jupyter.sns.gov for the first time.

The only exception is subdir "IPTS".
The IPTS subdir is organized by each IPTS number having
its own directory (the number as the directory name).
Only those IPTS that the user belongs to will be copied,
so that user's notebooks directory is not cluttered.
