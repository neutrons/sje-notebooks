# Notebook examples for SNS jupyter environment https://jupyter.sns.gov

These examples will be copied to a user's ~/notebooks directory
when he/she log into jupyter.sns.gov for the first time, 
or restarts his/her jupyter server (Control Panel->Stop Server->Start Server).

The only exception is subdir "IPTS".
The IPTS subdir is organized by each IPTS number having
its own directory (the number as the directory name).
Only those IPTS that the user belongs to will be copied,
so that user's notebooks directory is not cluttered
with unecessary files.
